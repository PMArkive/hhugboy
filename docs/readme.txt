[ UNLICENSED COMPATIBILITY MODES ] - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

 Auto      For unlicensed publishers with unique boot logos, the emulator will
           attempt to automatically determine which mode to use based on the
           logo present in the ROM.
           * "Niutoude" -> Li Cheng mode
           * part-inverted Nintendo (looks like "Kwichvu") -> Sintax mode
           This is not always a 100% reliable indicator though! 
           e.g. some Li Cheng games do not have the "Niutoude" logo.
           If a game doesn't work, try selecting the mode manually.

           For other games and multicarts, the detection is currently done
           based on the ROM title and size, meaning only certain predefined
           carts can be autodetected for now:
              - Vast Fame 12-in-1
              - Vast Fame 18-in-1
              - SL 36-in-1 with Chinese Pokemon Gold & Silver
              - 23-in-1 CR2011 with Super Mario Special 3
              - 25-in-1 NT-9920 with Rockman 8
              - 24-in-1 CY2060 with Donkey Kong 5, Sonic 8
              - 24-in-1 CY2061/CR2020 with Rockman X4, Sonic 8
              - Super Mario Special 3
              - Super Donkey Kong 5
              - Rockman 8
              - Rockman X4
              - Sonic Adventure 8

 Li Cheng  For games released by Li Cheng, also known as Xing Xing, Niutoude,
           Winsen or Yongsheng.

 Sintax    For games by Sintax. Please note this mode will definitely not work
           for anything other than a raw Sintax dump from a game using their
           own mapper! If the game is hacked to work on other emulators or a
           generic release from another company, it won't work.
           (However these roms SHOULD now be picked up by Auto mode)

 BBD       For games by BBD using their own mapper. Support isn't complete yet
           but works with known dumps.

 Hitek     For games by Hitek.

 NT old type 1/2
           Earlier carts released by NT, including older Makon games and some
           multicarts.
           Type 1: Rockman 8
           Type 2: Super Mario 3, Donkey Kong 5, rumble carts

 NT new    Later carts released by NT, specifically Makon single carts.
           No multicart support yet.

 Liebao Technology
           Currently only known to support 'Dragon Ball Z 3', the pirate
           English translation of DBZ Goku Gekitouden. Other games may use this
           too, especially Chinese translations.

 'Last Bible' multicart
           A type of multicart using menu music taken from 'Megami Tensei
           Gaiden: Last Bible' aka 'Revelations: The Demon Slayer'.
           This notably covers all of Vast Fame's multicarts, in addition to a
           number of more generic carts.

 MBC1/5 compatible
           For unknown carts that fake their header value but are actually
           compatible with common mappers.

 Disabled  No compatibility mode

 * If a GBX format ROM is loaded, this setting will be ignored, and the mapper
   specified in the GBX footer will be used instead.

[ CHEATS ] - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

 Cheats are supported in two formats:
 
 Game Genie     xxx-xxx-xxx or xxx-xxx
                Same as the Game Genie cheat device. 
                Codes and documentation undoubtedly available online somewhere
 
 Address/Value  xxxx=yy
                xxxx = address, yy = value, in hexadecimal. e.g. 1234=1F

 The Memory Search functionality can assist in finding memory addresses to use
 with the address/value format. It allows you to search for specific values in
 memory, and by checking the "in previous result set" option, you can then
 search only in the results of the previous search, allowing you to narrow down
 memory locations that may contain something of interest (lives, time, etc).

 * Note this currently has the limitation that you have to know the *exact*
   value you are searching for- it doesn't allow you to do "greater than/
   less than" type searches like some other emulators)

[ COMPATIBILITY ]- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

 This emulator was primarily designed for Windows, but it will also run on
 Linux using WINE. However it has not been extensively tested in this
 environment - your mileage may vary. 

[ ISSUES ] - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

 * Loading from Zip fails with Unicode chars anywhere in the filename or path.
   (However it still works if the file inside the zip is named unicodely)
 * Unicode filenames will not be preserved for screenshots
 * Compatibility mode selection does not autosave. May/may not be beneficial
 * Saved games will probably be lost if you load the same game in different
   compatibility modes
 * You can't choose the screenshot directory
 * Pirate mapper autodetection is not 100%, you may have to manually select
   for some games.
 * 8x nearest scaling is slow, if you have speed issues you may want to use
   another mode
 * Emu freezes unrecoverably if you press Ctrl+Alt+Del, standby or lock the PC 
 * (Visual) rumble only works for the first Makon game you load
 * On a multicart, loading a savestate from a mono game while playing a colour
   game (including the menu) will not work properly

[ FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS? ] - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

 If I ever have the time/skill/motivation

 * Action Replay cheats
 * Implement a rendering engine other than DirectDraw
 * Other language translations
 * Proper MMM01 support
